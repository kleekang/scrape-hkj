She added that from the 550 Metres she continued to encourage her mount into the race before LEAN MASTER gave ground in the Home Straight.

When questioned, K Teetan stated that his instructions were to lead the event.  He said as a result in the early stages he rode his mount along to comply with his instructions where his mount showed good pace to hold the front.  He said whilst he was aware that the pace of the event was fast his mount was travelling comfortably in the early stages to hold the lead.  He added when GLORY ELITE maintained its position to his outside near the 900 Metres and as its rider Z Purton showed intent on crossing LADY’S CHOICE he then elected near the 900 Metres to allow GLORY ELITE to cross LADY’S CHOICE as he was of the opinion the pace of the event was too fast.  He said after obtaining a trailing position behind GLORY ELITE, LADY’S CHOICE travelled only fairly and for this reason near the 500 Metres he elected to shift LADY’S CHOICE to the outside of GLORY ELITE to encourage it to maintain its position and to commence to improve into the event.  He said after entering the Home Straight he held his mount together for a short distance before commencing to ride it out to the finish of the event and LADY’S CHOICE continued to respond to his riding to the line.

Sent for sampling post-race. 3 7 WHIZZ KID (E392) No report. 4 6 GLORY ELITE (H311) When questioned regarding his riding in particular the fast pace set in the early and middle stages, Z Purton stated that his instructions were to ensure that GLORY ELITE led as the horse performs best when ridden in this manner.  He said after riding his mount along in the early stages he continued to urge GLORY ELITE forward to cross LADY’S CHOICE.  He said when K Teetan, the rider of LADY’S CHOICE, maintained his position in the lead, he was obliged to make further use of his mount to cross that runner to comply with his instructions.  He said whilst he was aware that the pace of the event was being run inside of standard time he felt it was in the horse’s best interests to continue forward as GLORY ELITE had only won its races when being able to dictate from the front.  Trainer K H Ting confirmed the instructions issued and expressed satisfaction with the manner in which GLORY ELITE was ridden.  After considering his explanation and taking into account the racing history of GLORY ELITE which confirmed that the horse had won its three races from leading and Jockey Purton was riding to the instructions issued, the Stewards found the tactics adopted by Jockey Purton were in all the circumstances reasonable.  However, he was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, he would have been better suited by maintaining his position outside of LADY’S CHOICE in the early stages having regard to the fast pace set during the early and middle stages of the event.

When questioned, M Chadwick stated that from a wide barrier the instructions were to endeavour to hold a midfield position but also to attempt to position himself close to the rail as HO HO STAR races best in this position.  He said in the early stages when positioned to the outside of MULTIDARLING he was obliged to settle slightly further back to avoid covering additional ground.  He added making the Home Turn HO HO STAR commenced to travel reasonably well and after entering the Home Straight he was reluctant to place his mount under full pressure as he wanted to give HO HO STAR the opportunity to work into the race.  He said approaching the 300 Metres after shifting to the inside of COMMANDING MISSILE he then placed his mount under full pressure where it finished the race off reasonably well.  When questioned if there was an opportunity to ride his mount with more vigour between the 400 Metres and the 300 Metres M Chadwick stated that he felt HO HO STAR was travelling well at this point and had he commenced to ride it along too soon it would not have finished the race off as well as it did.  Trainer C H Yip confirmed the instructions issued and advised that in the circumstances there was the opportunity to ride HO HO STAR with more vigour than Jockey Chadwick did in the early part of the Home Straight.  After considering his explanation and also taking into account the early and middle stages of the event were run outside of standard time, the Stewards advised M Chadwick that, in their opinion, he had made an error of judgement in not riding his mount with more vigour in the early part of the Home Straight. 7 12 CALIFORNIA ICON (H404) Near the 250 Metres was bumped by COMMANDING MISSILE.  After the event, Y L Chung stated that, in his view, CALIFORNIA ICON would be suited by being stepped up in distance.
